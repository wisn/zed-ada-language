# Zed Ada Language

Ada language support for Zed.

## Acknowledgment

The [wisn/tree-sitter-ada](https://github.com/wisn/tree-sitter-ada) repository that is used by this project
is forked from the [briot/tree-sitter-ada](https://github.com/briot/tree-sitter-ada) repository.
All of the files below were originally created by @briot.

```
languages/
└── ada
    ├── folds.scm
    ├── highlights.scm
    ├── locals.scm
    └── textobjects.scm
```

Thus, all the credits go to @briot.
However, there might be some modifications to those files depending on my need
to support the Ada programming language on the Zed text editor.
